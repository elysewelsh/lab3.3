What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
    I used Tailwind, but it was mostly just repetitive. Tailwind makes it much easier to implement style changes, but things like "border border-[3px] border-black" instead of "border: 3px solid black" make using CSS more simple. The fact that all your styles are applied per class in CSS makes it easier to track and make changes to styles. Even keeping track of divs was difficult without CSS class names. And having to apply styles to each individual div was time-consuming.


How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
    I didn't get to use the Bootstrap utility classes and components in the labs, but I made attempts to. I hated that customization wasn't available without making a CSS stylesheet anyway. The fact that Tailwin offers this (customizing colors or fonts) makes Tailwind a better choice generally. Using the card and accordian, etc. components would help if you didn't need to adhere to anyone else's design. If you are accepting of Bootstrap's inherent design, you will get benefit from the utility classes and components.


In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
    Custom fonts and colors are the only things I've come across so far, but it seems like they have a big impact too.
